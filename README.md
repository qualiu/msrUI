# Help Using msr EXE by Auto Show Usage + Examples

While [**msr**](https://github.com/qualiu/msr/blob/master/README.md#liberate--digitize-daily-works-by-2-exe-file-processing-data-mining-map-reduce) and [**vscode-msr**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=qualiu.vscode-msr) (repo: [here](https://github.com/qualiu/vscode-msr)) are widely used by more and more developers day by day, there're feedbacks of desiring an UI helper to explain the 70+ options and compose them, so I wrote this.

The usage and examples are extracted from **`"msr --help"`** (same to running [**"msr -h"**](https://github.com/qualiu/msr#msr-overview-windows-or-linux) or just **"msr"**).

# Build

- Run [install-apps.bat](https://github.com/qualiu/msrUI/blob/main/msrDesktop/install-apps.bat) as **Admin** to install softwares like `dotnet-core`.
- Run [build.bat](https://github.com/qualiu/msrUI/blob/main/msrDesktop/build.bat) and you will see the output `msrDesktop.exe` path.
